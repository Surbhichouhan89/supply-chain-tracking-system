Supply Chain Tracking System
Project Description
The Supply Chain Tracking System is a blockchain-based solution built on Ethereum that enables transparent and immutable tracking of products throughout their lifecycle in a supply chain. By leveraging blockchain technology, this system ensures data integrity, prevents fraud, and allows all stakeholders to verify the authenticity and journey of products from manufacturer to consumer.

Project Vision
Our vision is to create a decentralized ecosystem that brings transparency and trust to global supply chains. We aim to solve common supply chain challenges such as counterfeiting, inefficient record-keeping, and lack of traceability by providing a secure and verifiable digital ledger that tracks products at every stage of their journey. This system will enable businesses and consumers to make informed decisions based on accurate and tamper-proof supply chain data.

Key Features
Product Creation and Registration: Register new products with detailed information including manufacturer, production date, and expiry date.
Location Tracking: Record and track the movement of products across different locations with timestamps.
Stage Management: Monitor the progression of products through different stages of the supply chain (Manufactured, InTransit, Delivered, Sold).
Ownership Transfer: Securely transfer product ownership between different stakeholders.
Complete History: Access the complete and immutable history of a product's journey through the supply chain.
Expiry Date Verification: Verify product viability through expiry date tracking.
Transparent Verification: Allow any stakeholder to verify product authenticity and history.
Future Scope
QR Code Integration: Generate unique QR codes for each product that can be scanned to view its blockchain-verified history.
IoT Device Integration: Connect with IoT sensors to automatically update product conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.) during transit.
Consumer-Facing Mobile App: Develop a mobile application that allows consumers to check product authenticity by scanning product codes.
Multi-Party Authentication: Implement a system where multiple parties must verify and approve each stage transition.
Analytics Dashboard: Create a comprehensive dashboard to analyze supply chain efficiency and identify bottlenecks.
Sustainability Tracking: Add features to track and verify sustainable practices throughout the supply chain.
Integration with Existing ERP Systems: Develop connectors to popular Enterprise Resource Planning systems for seamless data flow.
Cross-Chain Compatibility: Extend the solution to operate across multiple blockchain networks.
